# haunt.nvim

Floating windows for terminals, man pages and help buffers.

> **haunt** (noun):
>   *a place frequented by a specified person or group of people*

This [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) plugin, written in Lua, offers alternative
commands to open embedded terminals, man pages and help buffers in floating
windows. Existing terminal buffers can also be opened in the floating window.

Install the plugin using your preferred plugin manager. Alternatively, NeoVim
can load packages if they are added to your 'packpath'.

Available commands and options are described in `:help overview`.
